BEFORE STARTER SCHOOL
======================

Worked Retail, and now Wholesale for the last 11 years delivering custom rims and tires to small family business in the MidWest.  

Spent Many years talking to people, getting to know their cars, and matching them up with something that will show their personality.

Made Catalogs, and Brochures that Retail Store Owners used to find and offer rims to their customers.


MALEFICENT

Same ITEM but WHO WEARS it MATTERS


8 1/2 MONTHS LATER
I finally organized a customer list to start doing email campaigns and offering content that had value.
Sold some rims from the Email links.

<------------------->

Adding RIMS to things is MORE EXCITING

Before I used a Brain Box I made as storage for all my tutorial documentation on my quest for trying to have a smoother OPERATIONS FLOW at work.

I made a Table of Contents to help me document and give credit to those I was learning from.

I tried to use spreadsheets to split up the product information and make it easier to find items.

Learned how to make Catalogs, and Brochures to help the Retail Store Owners offer rims and make sales.

We would attend the Chicago Auto Show to help display the new styles coming to Chicago.

->>>>>> THEN

I learned how to take the train everyday to 1871 for Starter School.

Where I started my Never Ending Story to find - Who Am I ? because everything else will come from that.

Cars. Rims. Computers. Family Businesses. Everytime I see a car with rims I just want to see which ones are on it. Then saw this Mustang Downtown with rims that had just barely came out 1 week before.


Then made picture into an email campaign with over 200 opens, 35 customers attended, and 11 stores placed orders.

Was able to chat with many family businesses -BUT this time I was able to direct my questions more efficiently and learned that a Mobile App is what they all said would help them sell. Learning to what to listen for has helped from Starter School.  Something the customers could use on their phone to choose their car, and find what styles they could get same or next day installed.
